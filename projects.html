                                    Although frequently changing and updating through recent versions of Blender, Geometry Nodes continue to be an incrediable resource. This is a project created 
                                    to improve my understanding of the nodes. I have since gone on to write BPx Emitters and many other time-saving tools using a combonation of geometry nodes and 
                                    a custom-scripted Python UI panel, as pictured here.
