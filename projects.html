                                This was just a side-project, to keep my rigging skills up-to-par between projects. Not too much to clean up with shape keys on this

                                A small looping project, showcasing just the tip of the iceburg on my BPx particle editor addon for Blender. 
                                Particles are predicted over frames, allowing for seamless looping and immediate run (no baking/simulating). 
                                Shaders on the sword are procedural stylized materials simulating reflected light, but in a way which is 
                                exactly replicable in Unity.

                                I rigged and animated this RV in various states of activity, exaggerated start, stop, turn, etc.
                                All animations are done in a stationary position for use in Unity. Here I have a mock-up of a start, idle while driving, then stop.
                                I created multiple variations of each of these states and set the Gameobject up in Unity, complete with scripts for control and 
                                a concise Animation Controller.

                                       Although frequently changing and updating through recent versions of Blender, Geometry Nodes continue to be an incrediable resource. This is a project created 
                                       to improve my understanding of the nodes. I have since gone on to write BPx Emitters and many other time-saving tools using a combonation of geometry nodes and 
                                       a custom-scripted Python UI panel, as pictured here.
