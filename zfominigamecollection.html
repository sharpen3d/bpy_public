                        <p class="standard">
                            To fulfill a promise to our customers who had invested in characters as NFTs, our team faced a critical deadline to deliver engaging, playable experiences where they could utilize these characters. In a situation where delays and shifting priorities led to unfulfilled projects, my fellow technical artist and I took the initiative to create playable web-based games. Without a dedicated development team, we rapidly developed three fully functional web games that allowed our users to play as any of the 26 characters, integrating smoothly with backend systems and achieving what had previously been thought impractical in a short timeframe.
                            <br><br>
                            Through collaborative problem-solving and intensive iteration, we released <b> three unique, fully playable experiences within about a month.</b>

                            I am by far most proud of the car mechanics developed to bring this game to fruition, utilizing real-world-engine and wheel simulation, friction, transmission, downforce, and more playing into the feel of the cars in-game.
                            <br><br>
                            Racing spline development was a rewarding mechanic to develop, unlocking the ability for AI to follow the track, laps to be counted correctly, and any track to be developed and used.
                            We ultimately decided on a simple loop track for the initial release, being the most easily playable of the games, hitting our young target audience.

                            Scene optimization - The environment for this experience was purposed previously for pre-rendered sequences, which had to be optimized, reduced, and collisions and interaction added for a more cohesive experience.

                            Test of viability - This experience was created first as a test of web integration, a proof of concept for testing all characters' look and initial mechanics on webGL, as well as verification of back-end character selection processes.
