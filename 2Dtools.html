                The Composition Panel within 2D Tools simply controls the 
                current scene render resolution. The Select Camera button 
                selects the camera associated with the current Scene (if one exists)
                <br><br>
                <em>For best results, set the composition size (or scene render resolution) before adding 2D layers 
                in the panel below. If this is changed after adding 2D layers, they will not be an accurate pixel 
                size (the panel will prompt you if this occurs and provide a method to fix)</em>

                <br>

                <br>
                The Solids panel is contextual based on selected objects (see below), and 
                contains functionality for creating planes as pixel-based 2D shapes relative to the Composition size.
                <br>
                The Make Camera 2D button sets the camera's transform to (0,0,10), faces the camera in the -Z direction, 
                sets the camera to Orthographic, and sets the camera's Orthographic size to 10. If no camera exists in Scene, 
                this button creates a new camera with the settings mentioned.
                <br><br>
                <em>For 2D layer size to be pixel-accurate, the camera must be orthographic, but can be any scale.
                <br>The camera faces -Z as to make the X axis left to right, the Y axis up and down, and the Z axis as depth</em>
                <br><br>
                The Add Layer button creates a new plane and applies a geometry node modifier "bpx_geo" to control the size of the plane 
                in pixes relative to the canvas size. By default, this plane is added at the size of 1024x1024 pixels. When Selected, 
                the user can manipulate the pixel size via the expanded panel shown below.
                <br><br>
                <em>There is no need to alter the values of the geometry node inputs outside of the 2D Tools panel</em>

                <br>

                <br>
                When a 2D layer is selected, additional options populate the panel. Set the pixel-size width and height of the 
                layer here.
                <br><br>
                The Match Cam Size button sets the 2D Layer's size to match the Canvas Size (render resolution).
                <br><br>
                Each 2D Layer, when added via the New Layer button, will appear with a unique material, allowing for an 
                image texture to be added. This texture is visible in this panel, and able to be changed.
                <br><br>
                The Match Texture Size button applies the image's resolution to the selected 2D layer (allowing for 
                quick reference images as planes)
                <br><br>
                <em>Any material can be applied to the 2D Layer, but functionality to add a texture will only be visible 
                when the default material (bpx_defaultMat) is active on the selected 2D Layer</em>
                <br><br>
                If canvas size (render resolution) or camera size (orthographic camera scale) is changed after adding 2D Layers, 
                an error message will appear in the panel, with a button "Fix Pixel Size". Select each 2D layer individually, 
                and click this button for each to make the pixel dimensions of the layer accurate to the render size.
